# EDDataUpdater
This is the TUT PalPo course excercise.

EDDN Ship(and in future some other data as well) data updater.

Uses both EDSN AND EDDN to provide an easy way to update Shipyard data to EDDN

User selects system he is in. 
Backend makes a query about the system and when system is found, shows a confirmation and maybe 5 nearest neighbours.

User writes station name he is docked is (Check is this can be confirmed on EDSN for example)

User select ships from a dropdown menu and appends them to a list. Reference: (https://eddb.io/station listing system)

When user is happy, he will be able to submit the data to EDDN.
